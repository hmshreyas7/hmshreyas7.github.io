### I am a graduate student pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at University of California, Davis. My primary areas of interest are Data Science/Machine Learning and Application Development.

## **Projects**

* ### **UEFA Euro 2016 Classifier**
  * Knockout match predictor built using logistic regression in Octave to predict winning teams
  * Dataset contained performance parameters for each team in the last 2 years such as goals scored, goals conceded, fixture difficulty, importance of match, etc.
  * Model classified teams into "winner" or "loser" for each match
  * Accuracy: 73.3% (11 out of 15)

* ### **McDonald's Menu Analysis**
  * Stacked bar graph of %DV values created using matplotlib and pandas to analyze food quality
  * Parameters considered: total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, and carbohydrates
  * 70.4% (183 out of 260 items) contained 20% DV or more (classified "high" by USFDA) of at least 1 of these parameters

* ### **SRM GPA Calculator**
  * Android application with Material Design created to calculate semester-wise and cumulative GPA
  * Grading system as per SRM University's 2013-14 and 2015-16 regulations

* ### **Baymax Coder**
  * Tool for Windows and Android built to encrypt text messages using a 4-digit PIN
  * Algorithm for encryption used random assignment of keys for each character entered
