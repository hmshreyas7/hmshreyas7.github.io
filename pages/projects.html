                <p><span class="tech">Technologies used</span>: Flutter, Hummingbird, Firebase, Git</p>
                <p>I built this app as a part of "The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp Using Dart", a course by The App Brewery in collaboration with the Google Flutter team. It can run on both iOS and Android and a web version of the app was compiled using Hummingbird (Web support for Flutter). Users can register and login with their email IDs and passwords and this then takes them to a chat screen where they can interact with other users. The authentication is handled using Firebase's Auth package and all messages sent and received are stored using Cloud Firestore, Firebase's NoSQL document database. In addition, users receive all texts in real-time.</p>

                <p>COVID-19 gave me a new hobby: cooking. Trying out a few recipes motivated me to then build an app that I could use to organize what I wanted to cook and eat. In a nutshell, it allows users to add, edit, and delete dishes in two separate lists. Each dish can be marked as savory or sweet and depending on this, an appropriate icon is set next to the list item. Furthermore, these lists can be ordered in different ways as per the user's preference. After uploading this app to Google Play, it reached 2,000+ downloads in 3 weeks and was listed in the top 20 apps under "Food & Drink - Top New Free" in 16 countries.</p>

                <p><span class="tech">Technologies used</span>: TensorFlow, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</p>
                <p>Sometimes we know what something looks like but we don't exactly know what it is. In such cases, it really helps if we can just draw a quick sketch and let the computer identify it for us. That is exactly what this project (originally presented at CVPR 2018) does. Given a sketch, a realistic image of it is generated which can then be identified with an image-based search. Our team extended this work by examining the importance of 3 complex network components and presenting a new ablation study. In addition, we verified the adaptability of the model by evaluating it on 6,500 amateurish sketches of shoes.</p>

                <p><span class="tech">Technologies used</span>: TensorFlow, Git</p>
                <p>Deep learning models such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN have become quite popular for object detection in recent years. However, one thing that I noticed was that most of the sample results shown using these detectors involved images in broad daylight. Additionally, I found an interesting new dataset called 'ExDark' that contained images taken under dimly lit settings. This motivated me to develop the first known detector on GitHub for this dataset and in doing so, I succeeded in increasing the mean average precision (mAP) by 16% for Faster R-CNN under such conditions.</p>

                <p><span class="tech">Technologies used</span>: Express.js, D3.js, Node.js</p>
                <p>PivotPaths is an information visualization research paper that was presented at IEEE InfoVis 2012. The original work involved designing a convenient tool for gaining insights about research scholars and their publications. An almost identical interface was implemented by our team for roughly 1,200 newspaper articles and their authors using the NY Times Newswire API. We also took steps to enrich user experience by highlighting links between components in order to better visualize relationships.</p>

                <div class="logo"><img src="../images/yelp.png"></div>
                <p><span class="tech">Technologies used</span>: D3.js, TextBlob</p>
                <p>People often use Yelp to decide whether they should visit a particular restaurant or not. They read the reviews and see what other people had to say about their experiences. Going through all the reviews can, however, be quite tedious. It would be a lot easier if we could just focus on the most recent ones or the ones that are considered to be the most useful. This is what I did in this project by building a system that summarizes over 40,000 reviews for restaurants in 3 cities using creative visualizations and sentiment analysis. Additionally, the top 10 trends by year for each restaurant were identified by examining phrase frequencies.</p>

                <p><span class="tech">Technologies used</span>: D3.js</p>
                <p>Movie recommendations are quite common these days. When we use services like Netflix, we are provided with a variety of movies or shows to watch next based on what we have already watched. This project is similar except for the fact that we create our own recommendations. Information associated with 1,500 movies is depicted by linking a set of 3 visualizations. This interface allows users to discover movies and relations between them based on genre and matching keywords.</p>

                <p><span class="tech">Technologies used</span>: Keras</p>
                <p>Security applications today can identify a person's age, gender, and ethnicity with ease. However, a lot of them require a full view of the face looking forward with a neutral expression to work well. In this project, our team created a robust classifier for ethnicity prediction using over 23,000 images that can adapt to different poses, ages, and facial expressions. We successfully achieved an improvement of 9% in terms of prediction accuracy by fine-tuning a pre-trained model named VGGFace.</p>
