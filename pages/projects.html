                <p>Sometimes we know what something looks like but we don't exactly know what it is. In such cases, it really helps if we can just draw a quick sketch and let the computer identify it for us. That is exactly what this project (originally presented at CVPR 2018) does. Given a sketch, a realistic image of it is generated which can then be identified with an image-based search. Our team extended this work by examining the importance of 3 complex network components and presenting a new ablation study. In addition, we verified the adaptability of the model by evaluating it on 6,500 amateurish sketches of shoes.</p>

                <p><span class="tech">Technologies used</span>: TensorFlow, Git</p>
                <p>Deep learning models such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN have become quite popular for object detection in recent years. However, one thing that I noticed was that most of the sample results shown using these detectors involved images in broad daylight. Additionally, I found an interesting new dataset called 'ExDark' that contained images taken under dimly lit settings. This motivated me to develop the first known detector on GitHub for this dataset and in doing so, I succeeded in increasing the mean average precision (mAP) by 16% for Faster R-CNN under such conditions.</p>

                <p>PivotPaths is an information visualization research paper that was presented at IEEE InfoVis 2012. The original work involved designing a convenient tool for gaining insights about research scholars and their publications. An almost identical interface was implemented by our team for roughly 1,200 newspaper articles and their authors using the NY Times Newswire API. We took steps to enrich user experience by providing smooth, gradual transitions from one view to another as well.</p>

                <div class="logo"><img src="../images/yelp.png"></div>
                <p><span class="tech">Technologies used</span>: D3.js, TextBlob</p>
                <p>People often use Yelp to decide whether they should visit a particular restaurant or not. They read the reviews and see what other people had to say about their experiences. Going through all the reviews can, however, be quite tedious. It would be a lot easier if we could just focus on the most recent ones or the ones that are considered to be the most useful. This is what I did in this project by building a system that summarizes over 40,000 reviews for restaurants in 3 cities using creative visualizations and sentiment analysis. Additionally, the top 10 trends by year for each restaurant were identified by examining phrase frequencies.</p>

                <p><span class="tech">Technologies used</span>: D3.js</p>
                <p>Movie recommendations are quite common these days. When we use services like Netflix, we are provided with a variety of movies or shows to watch next based on what we have already watched. This project is similar except for the fact that we create our own recommendations. Information associated with 1,500 movies is depicted by linking a set of 3 visualizations. This interface allows users to discover movies and relations between them based on genre and matching keywords.</p>

                <p><span class="tech">Technologies used</span>: Keras</p>
                <p>Security applications today can identify a person's age, gender, and ethnicity with ease. However, a lot of them require a full view of the face looking forward with a neutral expression to work well. In this project, our team created a robust classifier for ethnicity prediction that can adapt to different poses, ages, and facial expressions using over 23,000 images. We successfully achieved an improvement of 9% in terms of prediction accuracy by fine-tuning a pre-trained model named VGGFace.</p>
